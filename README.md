## Project Description

The **DonboscoApp Airlines** project is an integrated management system for an airline, designed with a monolithic architecture on Spring Boot. This system facilitates the administration of users, flights, reservations and destinations, and has advanced functionalities such as secure authentication through JWT and automatic administration of flights and seat availability. Everything is implemented in **Java 17**, **Maven** and **MySQL**.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Strengthen** knowledge in RESTful API creation.
2. **Implement** database relationships for efficient modelling.
3. **Manage** real-time data concurrency.
4. **Configure** secure authentication with Spring Security and JWT.
5. **Automate** integration and deployment testing with GitHub Actions.

---

## Functional Requirements

### User Management
- User registration, authentication and roles (ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER).
- Generation and validation of JWT tokens for secure sessions.

### Flight Management
- Automatic generation of flights in database at compilation time.
- Change of status from ‘available’ to ‘unavailable’ for flights without seats or out of date.

### Booking Management
- Creation of reservations only if there is availability and valid route.
- Check availability of seats before confirming reservations.

### Flight Destination Management
- CRUD of destinations associated to flights (accessible only for ROLE_ADMIN).

### Consultation and Management of Users
- Complete CRUD (management exclusively for ROLE_ADMIN).
- Consultation of booking history for each user (ROLE_USER).

### Exception Management
- Custom exception handling for a consistent user experience.

---

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Security**: Implementation of Spring Security and JWT for API protection.
- **Performance**: Optimisation of automatic flight status and booking management.
- **Scalability**: Monolithic design adaptable to microservices architecture in the future.
- **Availability**: Unit and integration tests to guarantee stability in production.
- **Normative**: No use of Lombok, ensuring code clarity.
